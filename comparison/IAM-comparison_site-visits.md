Other than IADB, which only allows review of records, all of the mechanisms allow site visits for eligibility determinations. All of the mechanisms allow site visits in the investigation phase, however, none of the mechanisms require site visits. Only WB IP has a provision to allow site visits to communicate outcomes to claimants, but the other mechanisms donâ€™t prohibit such a visit.

Only EBRD, AfDB, and WB IP require management to create an action plan to address eligible claims.
