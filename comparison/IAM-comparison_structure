Each mechanism, except the WB IP, has both a problem solving function and a compliance review function. Only EIB and CAO have an official advisory function. EIB is the only mechanism with the right to appeal, with a process for unsatisfied claimants to complain to the European Ombudsman. Most of the mechanisms have training procedures, but AfDB, EIB, and OPIC are lacking important provisions for training the institutionâ€™s staff about the mechanism. Most of the mechanisms require that information about the mechanism be distributed to project sponsors (except IADB, AfDB, and EIB).
