
Fairness and Accessibility

A primary issue within the principles of fairness and accessibility of these mechanisms is who can bring a claim and under what conditions. There is a trend toward allowing individuals to bring claims. There is also a trend toward allowing foreign representation, with the majority of mechanisms not limiting foreign representation to instances in which local representation is not available. Almost all of the mechanisms allow requesters to file complaints in national or official languages, and a majority of the mechanisms allow the local languages of the claimants. A little less than half of the institutions (namely, EBRD, EIB, CAO, and the compliance review function of OPIC) do not require an allegation of direct harm.

With respect to time boundaries, the majority of mechanisms require complainants to file requests within one year after full dispersal of funds. However, the CAO is a positive outlier in that it does not have a time limit for filing and the WB IP is a negative outlier in that it only allows claims prior to 95% dispersal of the loan.
None of the institutions allows a claimant to file anonymously, but all of the mechanisms allow confidential requests. EIB is the only mechanism with a presumption of confidentiality, which can be waived by the requestor. EBRD, AfDB, and IADB are the only mechanisms that do not have express provisions for keeping outside information confidential.

The majority of mechanisms require good faith efforts to resolve the grievance prior to entering the accountability mechanism process. However, exceptions to this rule are EIB, CAO, and the compliance review function of OPIC, which do not require such an effort. For mechanisms with a good faith efforts requirement, the EBRD embodies the best practice of waiving the requirement if it would be dangerous or futile to pursue good faith efforts.

If requesters express interest in both a problem-solving and compliance review, three of the mechanisms are sequenced and present a barrier to access (i.e. you must start in problem-solving), while three are not (meaning a claimant may proceed straight to compliance review).
