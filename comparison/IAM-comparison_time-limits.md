The time limits and efficiency guidelines for the mechanisms and the different steps in the process vary. EBRD and ADB are most efficient with a 2-5 day decision about whether to register the complaint. The CAO and IADB determine eligibility and which function to use quickly (within 2-3 weeks of registration). Only ADB and EIB offer an estimated full process timeline of less than 6 months, but these overall time limits may be unattainable in many cases. All of the mechanisms, except OPIC, have a provision that allows for the extension of time limits that are in place.
