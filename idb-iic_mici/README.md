of the Inter-American Development Bank

The IDB Board of Executive Directors established ICIM, which became effective on September 9, 2010. More details at: www.iadb.org/icim

Mission, Roles, Responsibility and Areas of Focus

Mission: The ICIM‟s core mission is to respond to Requests of
individuals , organizations and/or communities that have been or
believe they will be impacted because IDB has departed from its
Operational Policies, thus contributing to more sustainable
development results in the LCR Region.

Roles, Responsibility and Areas of Focus The ICIM is led and
manage by the three Principals: Executive Secretary, Project
Ombudsperson and Panel Chairperson. They report directly to
the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank. The Project
Ombudsperson and the Panel have functional independence and
act on their own initiative and according to their best judgment, in
a manner consistent with the ICIM Policy.
* Consultation Phase: The main objective of this phase is to provide
individuals and communities with an opportunity to voice and address
their concerns through a solution seeking dialogue sponsored by the
Project Ombudsperson. The approaches and tools used in the
Consultation Phase are flexible and collaborative, giving the parties the
opportunity to find agreeable remedial options and adequate mitigating
measures. In addition, as a result of the Consultation Phase, the Project
Ombudsperson would identify systemic issues that might have
contributed to the specific situation; gather lessons learned and extract
good practices targeted to improve the social and environmental
sustainability of IDB‟s operations.
* Compliance Review Phase: Enables individuals and communities to
request an investigation of a Bank-Financed Operation by a Compliance
Review Panel when they reasonably assert that their rights or interests
have been, or could be expected to be directly, materially adversely
affected by the failure of the IDB to follow its relevant Operational
Policies. The objective of a Compliance Review investigation shall be to
establish whether (and if so, how and why) any Bank action or omission,
in respect of a Bank-Financed Operation, has resulted in non compliance
with a Relevant Operational Policy and direct, material and adverse
effects (potential or actual) exist.
*  Principles: The ICIM follows, among others, the principles of
independence, integrity, impartiality, collaboration, responsibility and
predictability, Promotes transparency in Bank operations through its
Public Registry, and pursues a positive impact on Bank-finance
operations.

Reviews) contribute to improvements in the adherence to and the implementation of Operational
Policies, and thus to better and more sustainable projects and their results.
*  Consultation Phase

first analysis of requests is carried out to ensure that the eligibility criteria set forth in the ICIM Policy is met
and no exclusion applies. During this initial prima facie analysis, the merits of the request are not assessed.
*  Assessment Reports: These allow a close-up aimed at gathering relevant information and performing an
in-depth analysis of the requests and their alleged impacts, potential or actual.
*  Dialogue or Solution-Seeking Process: These are collaborative exercises that help the parties in the
clarification/prioritization of issues. Dialogue processes constitute an early warning tool to prevent and/or
manage escalation risks, among other.

inception is recorded; the main results and outcomes of the effort are made public and systemic lessons
are identified and collected.
*  Compliance Review Phase
*  Eligibility reports: If requesters decline to participate in a consultation or if consultations do not lead to
agreements, then the Panel conducts another eligibility determination to take account of evolving
circumstances.
*  Investigation reports and findings: Independent investigation and fact-finding assesses project-level
policy compliance, and leads to remedies for harm to people and environment. Findings reported directly to
the Board.
*  Bank Management Responses and Action Plan: In response to Panel findings on compliance and harm,
Bank Management prepares Response and Action Plan (with Government) to address findings. Reports
and findings are made available to requesters, affected people and the public.
*  Systemic Observations, Corporate Learning: Reports and Management Responses include systemic
observations and lessons learned which promote corporate learning and transparency through their
publication.
*  Public Awareness: Produces publications to inform public of its activities and for outreach (Annual Report,
press releases, etc).

strengthening and development effectiveness of IDB operations.

experts and Management across the institution. This interaction is mainly through independent problemsolving
exercises; fact-finding assessments, lessons-learned reporting and advisory services.

The IDB and the IIC, like many international organizations, enjoy immunity from jurisdiction of the courts of their member countries. For this reason, the Administrative Tribunal was established to adjudicate disputes which arise out of the employment relationship of the IDB or the IIC with their employees.

The Administrative Tribunal was established by the Board of Executive Directors of the IDB on April 29, 1981. The IIC became subject to the Administrative Tribunal’s jurisdiction by resolution of its Board of Executive Directors of November 19, 1991.

The Administrative Tribunal has issued 101 decisions since its creation through December 31, 2016.
