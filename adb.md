## [Compliance Review Panel (CRP)](http://compliance.adb.org/)

**About the Compliance Review Panel**

The compliance review function of ADB's Accountability Mechanism is done/undertaken by the Compliance Review Panel or CRP. The CRP investigates alleged noncompliance by ADB with its operational policies and procedures that has caused, or is likely to cause, direct and material harm to project-affected people.

Compliance review does not investigate the borrowing country, the executing agency, or the private sector client. The conduct of these parties will be considered only when relevant to the assessment of ADB’s compliance. Compliance review does not provide judicial-type remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages. Relative to the problem solving function of the Accountability Mechanism, a request for compliance review is not an appeal to a higher authority.

Compliance Review Panel

The CRP is a fact-finding body on behalf of the ADB's Board of Directors. The CRP investigates alleged noncompliance by ADB with its operational policies and procedures in designing and implementing ADB-financed projects.

The CRP has three members, one of whom is the chair. The CRP chair works full time and the other two CRP members are part time and are called on when required. Two members are from ADB's regional member countries, with one from a developing member country, and the third member from a non-regional member country.

The CRP does the following:
* investigate complaints requesting compliance review
* coordinate with other multilateral or bilateral compliance review mechanism conducting a separate review of the same project
conduct thorough and objective reviews of ADB compliance
* consult with the complainants, the borrower, the Board member representing the country concerned, Management, and staff on its preliminary findings;
* issue draft report and seek comments from the complainants, the borrower, the Board Compliance Review Committee, Management, and the operations department concerned;
* issue final compliance review report to the Board;
* monitor the implementation of Board’s decisions on compliance review and produce annual monitoring reports
* prepare and publish Accountability Mechanism annual reports jointly with the Office of the Special Project Facilitator
* produce a learning report every three years through joint efforts with the Special Project Facilitator, Independent Evaluation Department, and Regional Sustainable and Development Department
* develop a roster of independent technical experts who can assist the CRP in carrying out its work; and
* liaise with accountability mechanisms at other institutions.

The CRP chair:
* performs all the functions listed for the CRP;
* serves as the head of the Office of the Compliance Review Panel and have full responsibility for running the Office;
* manages the OCRP's personnel, budget, and work program under the oversight of the BCRC, and in accordance with ADB rules and procedures;
* assigns CRP member(s) who will conduct the compliance review and monitor tasks in consultation with the BCRC;
* provides regular (e.g., quarterly) briefings to the BCRC;
* prepares the annual work plan and budget for the CRP and OCRP;
* engages stakeholders in the compliance review process and ensure that compliance review results are communicated to them and the public;
* ensures high-quality professional work and set quality standards for OCRP outputs;
* formulates and implement the CRP’s and OCRP's work program and report activities to the Board
* provides feedback on CRP members’ performance to the BCRC

[Compliance Review Function](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/compliance-review-function)

The compliance review focuses on the direct and material harm alleged by project-affected people, and whether this is caused by ADB’s violations of its operational policies and procedures in formulating, processing, or implementing the project. The compliance review is done by an independent Compliance Review Panel (CRP).

The compliance review starts with the Compliance Review Panel determining the eligibility of a request for compliance review and recommending to the ADB Board of Directors to authorize a compliance review. If approved, the Compliance Review Panel conducts an independent investigation and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors to ensure project compliance, including remedial changes in the scope or implementation of the project. The Compliance Review Panel then monitors the implementation of its recommendations and any remedial actions approved by the Board of Directors.

Compliance Review Panel (CRP)
The Compliance Review Panel is an independent body appointed by the ADB’s Board of Directors to carry out compliance review under the second phase of the ADB Accountability Mechanism. The Compliance Review Panel consists of three members—a full-time Chair and two part-time members. Two Compliance Review Panel members are from regional member countries, with one of them from a developing member country, and the third member from a nonregional country. The Compliance Review Panel reports directly to the Board on all activities except on two specific activities where it reports to the Board Compliance Review Committee.

## [Special Project Facilitator	(SPF)](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/problem-solving-function/office-special-facilitator)

The Office of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF) is responsible for the problem solving function of the ADB’s Accountability Mechanism.

People who believe they have been adversely affected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem solving function regardless of whether ADB operational policies and procedures have been violated. However, complainants must first make a good faith effort to resolve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department.

Project-affected people are at the core of the problem solving function, however, the Office of the Special Project Facilitator does not assume that ADB operations departments, the government, or private project sponsors are less sensitive to project-affected people’s concerns. In seeking solutions to problems, the Office of the Special Project Facilitator aims to win the confidence of all parties.

The second mandate:

The Special Project Facilitator problem solving function also aims to strengthen the internal problem solving processes of ADB's operations departments.  The Special Project Facilitator will carry out activities designed to improve the overall internal problem solving functions of ADB

Guiding principles:

OSPF is guided by the principles of:
* Enhancing ADB development effectiveness and project quality;
* Being responsive to the concerns of project-affected people, and treating all stakeholders fairly;
* Reflecting the highest professional and technical standards in its staffing and operations;
* Being independent and transparent; and
* Being cost-effective, efficient, and complementary to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and evaluation systems at ADB.

What we do:
* Help solve problems caused by ADB-assisted projects through a number of informal, consensus-based methods with the consent and participation of the concerned parties.
* Initiate and guide the consultation process and facilitate development of solutions to the issues identified by different stakeholders.
* Provide opportunities for all parties to meet and discuss their concerns—individually on a strictly confidential basis, when requested, or in meetings among themselves, or in joint deliberations with other parties.
* Provide independent facilitators for dialogues and meetings.

[The Problem Solving Function](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/problem-solving-function)


The problem solving function assists people who are directly, materially, and adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects to find solutions to their problems. It is led by ADB’s Special Project Facilitator (SPF).

The problem solving function starts with consideration of the eligibility of the complaint. If accepted, the focus will be on seeking agreement among all the parties involved such as the complainant, project implementer, developing member country government or private sector sponsor, and ADB. The Special Project Facilitator will, however, not interfere in the internal matters of a developing member country.

The general approaches in the problem solving function include (i) consultative dialogue, (ii) information sharing, (iii) joint fact-finding, and (iv) mediation. The SPF may also suggest various specific approaches to resolve problems, such as convening meetings, organizing and facilitating problem solving processes, or engaging in a fact-finding review of the situation.

The problem solving function is outcome driven. It will not focus on the identification and allocation of blame, but on finding ways to address the problems of the project-affected people.

The Special Project Facilitator offers an additional avenue for problem solving but does not supplant the project administration and problem solving functions of ADB’s operations departments. He/ she reports directly to the President of ADB and recommends actions to deal with the complaint. He/she will also monitor implementation of agreements resulting from the problem solving process.
