[Process flow: How we handle your complaint](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/complaint-process-flow)

You have sent your complaint to the Complaint Receiving Officer. What happens next?

You have two choices:

Problem solving - This tries to help you find a solution

The **Special Project Facilitator** will:

* handle your complaint
* ask you to clarify what the complaint is and what harm was caused
* help you, the ADB operation department, and the government to explore possible solutions
* help everyone involved to agree on what needs to be done to solve your problem
* then, monitor the actions agreed upon

See detailed information on the [problem solving function](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/problem-solving-function).

or

Compliance review - This finds out if ADB has followed its policies and procedures

The **Compliance Review Panel** will:

* investigate ADB based on your complaint
* consult with everyone involved in the project
* write a draft report, which you can comment on
* give its findings to the ADB Board of Directors in its final report

Should there be noncompliance, ADB will formulate a remedial action plan, in consultation with the borrower and have it approved by the ADB Board of Directors before the remedial actions are implemented. The CRP will monitor the implementation of remedial action up to 3 years from implementation of such.

See detailed information on the [compliance review function](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/compliance-review-function).

## [Compliance Review Panel (CRP)](http://compliance.adb.org/)

**About the Compliance Review Panel**

The compliance review function of ADB's Accountability Mechanism is done/undertaken by the Compliance Review Panel or CRP. The CRP investigates alleged noncompliance by ADB with its operational policies and procedures that has caused, or is likely to cause, direct and material harm to project-affected people.

Compliance review does not investigate the borrowing country, the executing agency, or the private sector client. The conduct of these parties will be considered only when relevant to the assessment of ADB’s compliance. Compliance review does not provide judicial-type remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages. Relative to the problem solving function of the Accountability Mechanism, a request for compliance review is not an appeal to a higher authority.

Compliance Review Panel

The CRP is a fact-finding body on behalf of the ADB's Board of Directors. The CRP investigates alleged noncompliance by ADB with its operational policies and procedures in designing and implementing ADB-financed projects.

The CRP has three members, one of whom is the chair. The CRP chair works full time and the other two CRP members are part time and are called on when required. Two members are from ADB's regional member countries, with one from a developing member country, and the third member from a non-regional member country.

The CRP does the following:
* investigate complaints requesting compliance review
* coordinate with other multilateral or bilateral compliance review mechanism conducting a separate review of the same project
conduct thorough and objective reviews of ADB compliance
* consult with the complainants, the borrower, the Board member representing the country concerned, Management, and staff on its preliminary findings;
* issue draft report and seek comments from the complainants, the borrower, the Board Compliance Review Committee, Management, and the operations department concerned;
* issue final compliance review report to the Board;
* monitor the implementation of Board’s decisions on compliance review and produce annual monitoring reports
* prepare and publish Accountability Mechanism annual reports jointly with the Office of the Special Project Facilitator
* produce a learning report every three years through joint efforts with the Special Project Facilitator, Independent Evaluation Department, and Regional Sustainable and Development Department
* develop a roster of independent technical experts who can assist the CRP in carrying out its work; and
* liaise with accountability mechanisms at other institutions.

The CRP chair:
* performs all the functions listed for the CRP;
* serves as the head of the Office of the Compliance Review Panel and have full responsibility for running the Office;
* manages the OCRP's personnel, budget, and work program under the oversight of the BCRC, and in accordance with ADB rules and procedures;
* assigns CRP member(s) who will conduct the compliance review and monitor tasks in consultation with the BCRC;
* provides regular (e.g., quarterly) briefings to the BCRC;
* prepares the annual work plan and budget for the CRP and OCRP;
* engages stakeholders in the compliance review process and ensure that compliance review results are communicated to them and the public;
* ensures high-quality professional work and set quality standards for OCRP outputs;
* formulates and implement the CRP’s and OCRP's work program and report activities to the Board
* provides feedback on CRP members’ performance to the BCRC

## [Special Project Facilitator	(SPF)](https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/problem-solving-function/office-special-facilitator)

The Office of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF) is responsible for the problem solving function of the ADB’s Accountability Mechanism.

People who believe they have been adversely affected by an ADB-assisted project can use the problem solving function regardless of whether ADB operational policies and procedures have been violated. However, complainants must first make a good faith effort to resolve their problems by working with the concerned ADB operations department.

Project-affected people are at the core of the problem solving function, however, the Office of the Special Project Facilitator does not assume that ADB operations departments, the government, or private project sponsors are less sensitive to project-affected people’s concerns. In seeking solutions to problems, the Office of the Special Project Facilitator aims to win the confidence of all parties.

The second mandate:

The Special Project Facilitator problem solving function also aims to strengthen the internal problem solving processes of ADB's operations departments.  The Special Project Facilitator will carry out activities designed to improve the overall internal problem solving functions of ADB

Guiding principles:

OSPF is guided by the principles of:
* Enhancing ADB development effectiveness and project quality;
* Being responsive to the concerns of project-affected people, and treating all stakeholders fairly;
* Reflecting the highest professional and technical standards in its staffing and operations;
* Being independent and transparent; and
* Being cost-effective, efficient, and complementary to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and evaluation systems at ADB.

What we do:
* Help solve problems caused by ADB-assisted projects through a number of informal, consensus-based methods with the consent and participation of the concerned parties.
* Initiate and guide the consultation process and facilitate development of solutions to the issues identified by different stakeholders.
* Provide opportunities for all parties to meet and discuss their concerns—individually on a strictly confidential basis, when requested, or in meetings among themselves, or in joint deliberations with other parties.
* Provide independent facilitators for dialogues and meetings.
