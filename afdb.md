Mandate

The IRM’s mandate is to provide people adversely affected by a project financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) with an independent mechanism through which they can request the AfDB to comply with its own policies and procedures. The IRM intervenes when people or communities affected submit a complaint. In this way, the IRM can be considered as a recourse instrument for project affected people who have previously been unable to resolve their problems with the AfDB’s Management.

[Compliance Review](https://www.afdb.org/en/independent-review-mechanism/mandate-of-the-irm/compliance-review/)

The Director of CRMU and the IRM Experts determine eligibility of requests for compliance review.  After such determination, they must submit a Report to the Board of Directors or the President (depending on the status of the project approval) including recommendations to authorize or not a Compliance Review within 30 days. 

Once the Board of Directors or the President approves the review, the IRM Experts constitute the Compliance Review Panels to undertake the compliance review and receive the administrative and technical support from CRMU. Subject to the provisions of the Bank Group’s Disclosure and Access to Information Policy, the recommendation for a compliance review and the decision made by the President or the Board, as the case may be, is promptly communicated to the Requestors and any other interested person. A summary of the decision and the recommendation for a compliance review shall be published on the Bank Group’s website 

The Compliance Review Panel conducts Compliance Review in accordance with the authorized Terms of Reference and time-frame. The Compliance Review Panel may:

* Solicit additional oral or written information from, or hold meetings with the requestors and any interested party;
* Undertake site visits to the project(s) in issue;
* Retain additional expertise (consultants) to assist with an inquiry, assessment, review or exercise of specific issues.

After completing its investigations, the Compliance Review Panel shall within 30 days write the compliance review report containing the panel’s findings and recommendations and circulate it to the Bank Management for review and comments on factual matters only. The Bank Management shall submit its comments to CRMU/IRM within twenty-one (21) business days from the date of receipt of the draft report from CRMU/IRM; and upon receipt of comments from Bank Management, the panel shall finalise its report. 

The panel submits the Compliance Report that has considered Management factual amendments, if any, to the Board of Directors or the President (depending on the status of the project approval) including its findings and recommendations for:

* Any remedial change in the scope or implementation of the Bank financed project;
* Any remedial change to systems or procedures of the Bank to avoid a recurrence of similar non-compliance which resulted in complaints about harm; and
* Any further steps to be undertaken to monitor the implementation of the remedial action plans referred to above.

Subject to the provisions of the Bank Group’s Disclosure and Access to Information Policy, the Compliance Review Report shall be made available to the Requestors at the same time as it is submitted for consideration and decision by the Board of Directors. Thereafter, it is posted on the Bank Group’s website. 

Upon receipt of the Compliance Review Report by the President or the Board of Directors, the AfDB Management prepares a response and an action plan based on the findings of the Compliance Review Report. They submit it to the President, the Board of Directors, CRMU and the Requestors within 90 days.  Within 30 days from the date on which the Response and Action Plan are distributed to the Board of Directors, the AfDB Management consults with CRMU and agrees on a date for a joint presentation of the Compliance Review Report and Management’s Response and Action Plan to the Board. 

Management must consult with CRMU not later than three (3) months from the date of consideration by the Board of Directors of the Management Action Plan. Management must also agree to prepare and submit to the Board  progress report on the status of implementation of the recommendations contained in the compliance review report that have been approved by the Boards together with the Management Action Plan..  The IRM Panel and CRMU (the IRM monitoring team) will review these reports and provide, if necessary, an assessment of the progress achieved in the implementation of the Management Action Plan and submit a report to the Board for consideration.  The IRM monitoring team will share its findings with Management and the Requestors for clarification of issues before submitting its report to the Board for consideration.

Subject to the provisions of the Bank Group’s Disclosure and Access to Information Policy, the decision made by the Board or the President, as the case may be, shall be promptly communicated to the Requestors and any interested party of such decision and the Compliance Review Report shall be published on the Bank Group’s website.

The Compliance Review Report may not recommend the award of compensation or any other benefits to the Requestors or any other person, entity or government beyond that which may be expressly contemplated in a relevant Bank Group policy.

Who are we?

The IRM provides people adversely affected by projects financed by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) with an independent mechanism through which they can request the Bank Group to comply with its own policies and procedures.[3](https://www.afdb.org/en/independent-review-mechanism/about-irm/)

[Who are we?](https://www.afdb.org/en/independent-review-mechanism/about-irm/who-are-we/)

The IRM provides people adversely affected by projects financed by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) with an independent mechanism through which they can request the Bank Group to comply with its own policies and procedures.

The IRM was established on 30 June 2004 by the Enabling Resolution B/BD/2004/9 - F/BD/2004/7 of the Boards of Directors of the AfDB and became operational in 2006, following the appointment of the first Director of the CRMU. This Resolution provided for the review of the experience of the IRM after three (3) years from the date of the effectiveness of the RIM, during when the IRM Director was appointed. Therefore, the performance of the IRM was assessed for the first time in 2009/2010, resulting in the adoption of a new IRM Resolution and Operating Rules and Procedures by the Boards of Directors on 16 June, 2010. This Resolution provided for review of the experience of the IRM every four years or otherwise as decided by the Board. Accordingly, the second review of the IRM took place in 2014/2015 and the current IRM Resolution and the Operating Rules and Procedures were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 January 2015.

The IRM is administered by the Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU). Investigations are carried out by the Panel of Experts who report to the Boards of Directors.

The Compliance Review and Mediation Unit is the organisational entity of the Bank that administers the IRM. It was established by a Resolution of the Board and headed by a Director. The Director is assisted by professional and support staff.

CRMU maintains the IRM Roster of Experts and provides administrative and technical support to them when they constitute themselves into a compliance review panel when undertaking compliance reviews.

The IRM Roster of Experts comprises three (3) individuals appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the President of the Bank Group. They are selected on the basis of their knowledge of, and exposure to development issues in Africa and the operations of multilateral development banks as well their experience, expertise, integrity and ability to act independently. They constitute themselves into the IRM Panel of Experts to conduct compliance review investigations. They enjoy total independence from Bank Management in their investigations.

The IRM handles requests through;

Compliance Review (investigation), and
Problem-Solving (mediation).
The IRM performs also an advisory function, consisting of advisory services and spot-check advisory reviews of project compliance.

The compliance review and spot-check advisory reviews of project compliance are undertaken by the IRM Panel of Experts.

CRMU undertakes the problem-solving exercises, advisory services and outreach activities to fulfill its mandate and to contribute to the AfDB's overall objectives.

Consultants

Consultants may be hired to assist CRMU and the Compliance Review Panels to assist with investigations and fact-finding missions. Consultants with experience in compliance review and problem-solving can send their applications to the CRMU, and register themselves in DACON- a database of Individual Consultants and Consulting Firms maintained by the African Development Bank Group.

[What we do?](https://www.afdb.org/en/independent-review-mechanism/about-irm/what-we-do/)

Problem Solving - Mediation

In a request for problem -solving, CRMU will restore an effective dialogue between the requestors and any interested persons with an aim to resolving underlying issues without seeking to attribute blame or fault to any such party.

Compliance Review - Investigation

The compliance review function is handled by the IRM Roster of Experts comprising three external professionals, appointed by the Board of Directors for a five-year non-renewable term. The Experts together with the Director of CRMU determine eligibility of request(s) for compliance review, and submit their eligibility report, recommending whether or not to undertake the compliance review, to the Board of Directors or to the President, as the case may be for project's status of approval. 

Advisory Service 

CRMU and the IRM do have an advisory function. This is authorized by the President and/or the Board when they are of the opinion that projects, programs, policies and procedures of the Bank Group can benefit from the accumulated experience of the IRM and support efforts of staff and Management to strengthen the social and environmental impact of the projects funded by the Bank Group. The advisory function enables CRMU to provide independent opinions on systemic issues, technical advice on any projects and programs of the Bank Group, and to support efforts of staff and Management to strengthen the social and environmental impact of projects funded by the Bank Group. The advisory function consists of Advisory services by CRMU and Spot-check advisory reviews of project compliance undertaken by IRM Experts.

Outreach

CRMU carries out outreach activities to raise awareness of Bank staff, civil society organizations, project affected communities and other stakeholders about the mandate and procedures of the IRM.

Consultants

Consultants may be hired to assist CRMU and the Compliance Review Panels with investigations and fact finding missions. Consultants with experience in compliance review and problem-solving can send their applications to the CRMU, and register themselves in DACON- of the African Development Bank Group.

Procedure upon Receiving a Request

Within fourteen (14) business days of receipt of the request, the Director shall conduct a preliminary review and decide whether to register or ask for additional information, in which case the decision period may be extended until the requested information and documents are received. The Director shall not register any request that is outside the mandate of the IRM.
If the Director of CRMU determines that the Request contains a bona fide allegation of harm arising from an AfDB-financed operation, she/he shall register the request for Problem-Solving, or for a Compliance Review.

The Requestors’ preference for problem-solving exercise or compliance review or both shall be granted subject to the Request meeting the requirement for registration. Where the Requestors have not expressed a preference, the CRMU Director will determine the best course of action in consultation with the Requestors.

Request Registration

The Director of CRMU shall, while respecting the preference of Requestor, issue a Notice of the Registration of Request. A copy of this notice shall be posted in the IRM Register of Requests. A copy of this Notice shall be promptly posted on the IRM website and sent to the Requestors, the Boards of Directors and the President of the Bank.

The Director of CRMU will request AfDB Management to provide a written evidence that it has complied, or intends to comply with the AfDB’s relevant policies and procedures within 21 days after receipt of the Notice of Registration.

After receiving the Management response to the Request, the Director CRMU shall, within 5 business days, while respecting the preference of the Requestors, make a determination on whether the Request should be handled through:
* a problem-solving exercise,
* compliance review or,
* both problem solving and compliance review. In the latter case, the sequencing will be problem solving followed by compliance review.

Once this determination is made, the Director shall promptly notify the Requestors, the Boards and the President of the proposed remedial course of action and the reasons thereof.
