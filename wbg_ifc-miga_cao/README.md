CAO's mandate 

The Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) is the independent recourse mechanism for projects supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)--the private sector lending arms of the World Bank Group. CAO was established in 1999 and reports directly to the President of the World Bank Group. 

CAO works to:

* Address the concerns of individuals or communities affected by IFC/MIGA projects

* Foster greater public accountability of IFC and MIGA 

The Office of the CAO is based in Washington, DC. 

CAO Operational Guidelines 

CAO's Operational Guidelines explain how CAO carries out its work in response to complaints and requests for audit related to IFC/MIGA supported projects. Specifically, the Operational Guidelines aim to provide a predictable process to guide complainants and other stakeholders through CAO's complaint-handling process. The guidelines are available in the seven official languages of the World Bank Group (see below).

Revised Operational Guidelines 2013

During 2012-13, CAO updated its Operational Guidelines in response to recommendations from recent external reviews of CAO’s effectiveness by the World Bank Group Board and an independent review team. The revised Operational Guidelines were released in March 2013. Click here for more details.

The CAO has three unique and complimentary roles, which together provide a flexible framework for handling people's complaints and addressing systemic concerns about IFC and MIGA projects.

The CAO's Three Roles 

Dispute Resolution (formerly Ombudsman)

CAO Ombudsman responds to complaints by people affected by the social and environmental impacts of IFC/MIGA projects. CAO Dispute Resolution works with stakeholders to resolve grievances using a flexible problem-solving approach, and ideally improving outcomes on the ground. CAO specialists are trained in alternative dispute resolution, with expertise in conflict assessment and management, mediation, and facilitation. Learn more about our [Dispute Resolution](http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/howwework/ombudsman/index.html) role. 

Compliance

CAO Compliance oversees investigations of IFC and MIGA's social and environmental performance, particularly in relation to sensitive projects to ensure compliance with relevant policies, guidelines, procedures, and systems. Learn more about our [Compliance](http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/howwework/compliance/index.html) role. 

Advisor 

CAO Advisor provides independent advice to the President of the World Bank Group and management of IFC and MIGA.  CAO advice focuses on broader social and environmental concerns, policies, procedures, strategic issues, and trends. CAO's emphasis is on improving IFC/MIGA's performance systemically. Learn more about our [Advisory](http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/howwework/advisor/index.html) role.

The CAO was created in 1999 to address complaints relating to the World Bank Group’s private sector arms – the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The CAO’s office has Advisory and Compliance functions, but it considers its Ombudsman function as its primary and most important responsibility. The Ombudsman function was designed to respond to complaints by persons who are affected by IFC/MIGA projects by “attempting to resolve fairly the issues raised, using a flexible, problem-solving approach.”  Any individual, group, community, entity, or other party affected or likely to be affected by the social or environmental impacts of an IFC or MIGA project may make a complaint to the Ombudsman. Representatives of those affected by a project may also file a complaint with appropriate proof of representation. The CAO acknowledges receipt of all complaints and evaluates whether the complaint falls within its mandate, and, if it does, whether to accept or reject the complaint. A complaint must demonstrate that the affected party has been, or is likely to be, affected by actual or potential social or environmental impacts on the ground. The complaint must relate to an aspect of the planning, implementation, or impact of an IFC or MIGA project.


Once a complaint is accepted, the CAO immediately notifies the complainant, registers the complaint, refers the complaint to the relevant IFC or MIGA personnel with a request for information, and informs the project sponsor of the complaint. The CAO then undertakes an assessment to determine how it proposes to handle the complaint. During the assessment, the CAO will communicate with the claimant, the project sponsor, and the IFC to attempt to identify a process for resolving the dispute. The CAO’s proposal may include anything from convening informal consultations with IFC/MIGA or the project sponsor to organizing a more formal mediation process. Overall, the ombudsman’s office seeks to take a proactive and flexible approach where the “aim is to identify problems, recommend practical remedial action and address systemic issues that have contributed to the problems, rather than to find fault.” If at any time after completion of the assessment the CAO Ombudsman believes that resolution of the complaint is not possible, the complaint is automatically transferred to the compliance side of the CAO for an assessment of whether a Compliance audit is warranted.


In both its Ombudsman and Compliance roles, the CAO has broad investigatory powers, including authority to review IFC or MIGA files; meet with the affected people, IFC or MIGA staff, project sponsors, and host country government officials; conduct project site visits; hold public meetings in the project area; request written submissions from any source; and engage expert consultants to research or address specific issues. Compliance audit findings are sent to senior IFC/MIGA staff for comment and ultimately to the President of the World Bank Group for review. The CAO concludes the complaint process either when an agreement has been reached through the Ombudsman or when the IFC/MIGA are deemed to be in compliance with their policies. In this regard, the CAO will keep any compliance audit “open and monitor the situation” until it is satisfied that IFC/MIGA are moving back into compliance. The Compliance audits and monitoring status of any projects under review are made public.

As of the end of 2010, the CAO’s office had received 79 claims, involving 41 different projects. While some of these claims have resulted in long and complex involvement by the CAO, others have involved relatively short interventions.
