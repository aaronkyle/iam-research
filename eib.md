## EIB [Complaints mechanism](http://www.eib.org/about/accountability/complaints/)

EIB [rules governing complaints](http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/complaints-mechanism-policy.htm) are set out in three key documents:

1. A [Memorandum of Understanding signed between the EIB and the European Ombudsman](http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-eo-and-the-eib.htm) in 2008 sets the scene for the two stage complaints process and achieves a common understanding of purpose and consistency of application across its internal and external parts.

2. The [Terms of Reference](http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/complaints-mechanism-policy.htm) lay out the role of the EIB-CM, including its status, authority, responsibilities, rules of conduct and relationship with the [European Ombudsman](http://www.eib.org/about/governance-and-structure/control_and_evaluation/ombudsman.htm) and the rest of the EIB. In addition, the Rules of Procedures have provisions regarding the different steps of the mechanism, such as admissibility, how to and about what to complain, and the methods of inquiry.

3. The [Complaints Mechanism Operating Procedures](http://www.eib.org/infocentre/publications/all/complaints-mechanism-operating-procedures.htm) implement the rules to: (i) clarify, improve and formalise current processes, (ii) facilitate and streamline handling of complaints, and (iii) facilitating better cooperation within the EIB and with stakeholders.
