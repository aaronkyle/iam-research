Because the compliance mechanisms at the IFIs have largely been modeled after and then improved on the World Bank Inspection Panel, the design of the Inspection Panel warrants particular attention. A second type of mechanism, with compliance review, dispute resolution and advisory roles is the World Bank Group’s CAO. These two World Bank Group accountability mechanisms are described below to present a feel for the structure and operations of two different existing mechanisms. We note that while the Inspection Panel and CAO are two of the longer established mechanisms, the regional banks created their accountability mechanisms later and have each undergone a substantial subsequent review, sometimes improving on the design of the Inspection Panel and CAO. Nonetheless, the overall structure and functions of the Inspection Panel and CAO remain most instructive.

The mandate of the Panel is to address complaints from project-affected people alleging non-compliance with World Bank policies and procedures. The Panel has no jurisdiction to review a complaint unless the project at issue in the complaint was financed in whole or part by either the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) or the International Development Association (IDA). The Panel is comprised of three permanent members, each of whom serves for five years. To ensure independence, Panel members cannot have served the Bank in any capacity for the two years preceding their selection, nor can they ever subsequently work for the Bank again. The Panel also has a permanent staff Secretariat to support its activities.

Claims to the Panel can be filed by any affected party or parties (other than a single individual) in the borrower’s national territory. Claims must be in writing and must explain how the affected parties’ interests have been, or are likely to be, directly affected by “a failure of the Bank to follow its operational policies and procedures with respect to the design, appraisal and/or implementation of a project financed by the Bank.” The claimant must demonstrate that it has exhausted other remedies by first providing Bank staff reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations. Upon receiving a complete request for inspection that is not clearly outside the scope of the Panel’s authority, the Panel registers the claim, notifies the claimant and the Board of Executive Directors, and forwards a copy of the claim to Bank Management, which has twenty-one days to respond. The Panel then has an additional twenty-one days to review Management’s response and to make a recommendation to the Board of Executive Directors regarding whether the claim warrants a full investigation.

The Board of Executive Directors has exclusive authority to authorize or deny a full investigation. While this led to significant politicization of the Panel process in the first few years, the Board has supported every Panel recommendation for an investigation since changes were made in 1999 after the Second Review of the Panel. Once an investigation is authorized, the Panel enjoys broad investigatory powers including access to all Bank staff. Members of the public may also provide the Panel with supplemental information relevant to the claim. After the investigation, the Panel issues a report evaluating the Bank’s compliance with its policies. Within six weeks of receiving this report, Bank Management must submit a report to the Board of Executive Directors with recommendations in response to the Panel’s findings. The Panel’s Report, Management’s response, and the Board’s decision are publicly released two weeks after Board consideration.

As of May 2011, the Inspection Panel had received 72 formal requests for inspection and had registered all but nine of them. The Panel had found that the eligibility requirements were met and recommended an investigation in thirty-two claims, and the Board had approved investigations in twenty-eight of those requests.  After findings of non-compliance, the Bank’s Board has taken a variety of measures depending on the type an extent of the violations found (sometimes minor, sometimes egregious), the type and stage of the project at issue (sometimes in project development and sometimes near completion), and the stakeholders involved (some borrowers/complainants have been more vocal than others).

As the first of the IFI accountability mechanisms, the Inspection Panel remains the only one without a dispute-resolution function at the corporate level. Each of the subsequently created mechanisms has dual, or even tripartite functions where advisory functions have been added. An example of a mechanism with three functions is the IFC and MIGA’s Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (“CAO”), worthy of review as a final example.

Panel Resolution and Mandate

The Panel was officially created by two resolutions of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Agency (IDA) on September 22, 1993 (Resolution IBRD 93–10 and Resolution IDA 93–6). It is referred to collectively as “the Resolution” because of their identical content. The Resolution specifies that the Panel has jurisdiction with respect to operations supported by the IBRD and the IDA.
The Resolution establishes the basic mandate and structure of the Panel. At its core, and in response to requests from affected people, the Panel has the power to carry out independent investigations of Bank-financed projects to determine whether the Bank is in compliance with its operational policies and procedures, and to make related findings of harm. The Panel reports its findings to the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors. Bank Management is required to prepare a response with recommendations and actions to address the Panel’s findings of noncompliance and harm. The Board of Executive Directors considers both the Panel’s findings and Management’s response and decides future actions. In 1996 and 1999 Clarifications were added to the Resolution.
