*	**Yanacocha-01:** The Choropampa Defense Front filed a claim in December, 2000, in response to the mercury spill of that year, stressing the impact of the accident on the health of the population. The CAO organized meetings with each of the parties, and an agreement was reached to undertake an independent health assessment. The recommendations were followed despite “numerous roadblocks” set by the Ministry of Health and civil society organizations. Finally, the CAO decided to close the case in November, 2003, citing the lack of social and institutional support.

*	**Yanacocha-02:** In March, 2001, the Rondas Campesinas Federation (Rural Patrols) filed another claim before the CAO on the Choropampa case, this time representing the localfarming communities that had suffered social and environmental impacts. In Septemberof that same year, the CAO threw its support behind the creation of a Roundtable for MultiSectorDialogue and Consensus. Over the course of four years this roundtable served as a bridge between the community and Yanacocha. The claim was closed in March, 2006.

*	**Yanacocha-03**: With the previous case barely closed, in March, 2006, 30 users of the canals came together to file a joint claim before the CAO. The claimants demanded greater information on the potential impact of mining activity on the water levels of the rivers,canals, and streams surrounding the project area. Spaces were established for dialogue and exchange of information between the parties. The request was closed in August, 2006.

*	**Yanacocha-04:** In November, 2012, the CAO received a case from members of a family in Cajamarca that claimed that the company never delivered the compensation they had promised in return for their grandfather’s land. The parties decided to resolve the conflictwith CAO mediation; after numerous meetings, however, no agreement was ever reached. Mediation came to a close in February, 2014, and in May, 2015 the CAO determined that no further investigation was warranted.

*	**Yanacocha-05:** Similar to the previous case, the Cerna Sánchez family came to the CAO with a case in May, 2013, claiming that Yanacocha had not provided any compensation for their family’s land. No agreement was reached, and the CAO closed the case in May, 2015.

*	**Yanacocha-06:** An ex-worker from Yanacocha filed a claim with the CAO in February, 2014, questioning the termination of his employment. The CAO met with the parties on multiple occasions, but the company chose to resolve the case through legal tribunals. The CAO closed the case in May, 2015.

*	**Yanacocha-07:** In March, 2014, a family presented a claim related to the process of landprocurement and compensation at the Minas Conga project site. This family felt that uponselling their land, compensation would be recalculated if the mine project proceeded. The company opted to resolve the case through their own channels of communication. The CAO closed the case in May, 2015.
